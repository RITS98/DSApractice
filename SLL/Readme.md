## Pairwise Swap Element in the Linked List by Changing Links (Important)

Approach:

Iterative Method:

    1. Take the 4 pointers ptrOne, ptrOne_prev, newhead and ptrTwo.
    2. Make ptrOne = head and ptrTwo = head.next.
    3. Store the reference of next node of ptrTwo, call it ptrTwoNext.
    4. Make the ptrOne.next = ptrTwoNext. (we have just swap the ptrOne).
    5. Make ptrOne_prev.next = ptrTwo; if ptrOne_prev is not null (swapped the ptrTwo).
    6. Make the ptrTwo as newHead (this step will happen only once).
    7. Move 2 nodes ahead for next pair wise swap.
Recursive Method:

    1. This approach is easy compare to iterative approach.
    2. Change the links for first two nodes.
    3. Make the recursive call to rest of the list.

## Intersection of Two Linked List

Method (By node count and difference)

Slight change in main method

Method ( 2-pointer technique ):

Using Two pointers :

    - Initialize two pointers ptr1 and ptr2  at the head1 and  head2.
    - Traverse through the lists,one node at a time.
    - When ptr1 reaches the end of a list, then redirect it to the head2.
    - similarly when ptr2 reaches the end of a list, redirect it the head1.
    - Once both of them go through reassigning,hey will be equidistant from
    the collision point
    - If at any node ptr1 meets ptr2, then it is the intersection node.
    - After second iteration if there is no intersection node it returns NULL.

After reaching null,

If two linked lists have intersection pointer, the two pointers will both move forward to length(A)+length(B) positions!

Time complexity: ùëÇ(ùëÄ+ùëÅ), 
space complexity: ùëÇ(1).
